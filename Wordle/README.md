Wordle Game
Overview
Wordle is a word-guessing game where players have six attempts to deduce a five-letter word. The game provides feedback after each guess, represented by colored tiles indicating the status of each letter in the guessed word.

Feedback Legend:
Green Tile: Indicates a letter that is correct and in the correct position within the word.
Yellow Tile: Represents a correctly guessed letter that is in the word but in the wrong position.
Gray Tile: The letter is not part of the word.
Handling Repeating Letters:
In cases where a letter appears multiple times in a guess (e.g., the "o"s in "robot"), the coloring will be determined by its occurrence in the word being guessed. If the letter appears multiple times in the answer, it will be marked green or yellow accordingly. However, if the letter doesn't occur multiple times in the word, the excess repeating letters will be marked gray.

Strategy and Deduction:
Players use the feedback from previous guesses to narrow down potential words. By analyzing the colors and positions of the tiles, players deduce which letters are correct and in the right positions, which letters exist but are misplaced, and which letters are not part of the word at all. Strategic guessing and deduction within the limited six attempts are crucial to unraveling the word.

Complexity and Challenge:
Wordle challenges players to employ a mix of vocabulary knowledge, deductive reasoning, and pattern recognition to deduce the hidden word accurately. The limited number of attempts intensifies the challenge, requiring careful analysis and informed guessing to succeed in uncovering the word within the constraints of the game.

Used programming Languages:
Python: the pygame library was used for implementing this game.
Running the Game:
The game is run by executing the make command in the terminal while being in the game's source folder.
